## Signal-to-Noise Ratio Guided Noise Adaptive Network via Dual-Domain Collaboration for Low-Light Image Enhancement

## dataset

### LOL datasets
The directory of LOL-v2-real should contain Real_captured/Train and Real_captured/Test.

The directory of LOL-v2-synthetic should contain Synthetic/Train and Synthetic/Test.

Please place the directory of LOL-v1, LOL-v2-real, and LOL-v2-synthetic under "datasets"

### SDSD dataset
Different from original SDSD datasets with dynamic scenes, we utilize its static version (the scenes are the same of original SDSD).

And you can download the SDSD-indoor and SDSD-outdoor from [baidu pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rfRzshGNcL0MX5soRNuwTA) (验证码: jo1v) and [baidu pan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JzDQnFov-u6aBPPgjSzSxQ) (验证码: uibk), and there should contain "indoor_static_np" and "outdoor_static_np".
They can also be downloaded from [google pan](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14TF0f9YQwZEntry06M93AMd70WH00Mg6?usp=share_link)
